Higher Education Teaching and Active Learning Methodologies,<br>Information Security and Multiplatform Mobile Application Projects.<br>
I taught Informatics for 8 years in the Municipal Education network of Belo Horizonte to Elementary School and EJA students.<br>

At the same time, I am a Technology Professor with a view to aligning the academic area with the professional technology market.<br>
